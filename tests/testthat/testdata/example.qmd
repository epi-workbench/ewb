title: "Demonstrating knitr to Markdown Image Conversion"
format: html
---

## Introduction

This document contains examples of R code blocks that use `knitr::include_graphics()` to display images. The purpose is to demonstrate how the `convert_knitr_images()` function can automatically convert these code blocks into standard markdown image syntax.

## Example: Code Block to Convert

The following code block uses `knitr::include_graphics()` to render an image. When processed by the function, it will be replaced with markdown image syntax.

```{r}
#| label: fig-using-console
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: Submitting R code in the console.

knitr::include_graphics("my_image.png")
```

## Example: Code Block That Should Not Be Converted

This block performs a typical R calculation and should remain unchanged.

```{r}
summary(mtcars)
```

## Expected Result

After running the `convert_knitr_images()` function, the first code block should be replaced by:

`![using_console.png](Replace with link)`

This replacement keeps the image reference in the document while removing the R code block wrapper.

## How to Use the Function

To use the `convert_knitr_images()` function:

1. Save your original Quarto or markdown file (e.g., `example.qmd`).

2. Call the function in your R session as shown below:

````
# Replace inline image code blocks in 'example.qmd'
convert_knitr_images("example.qmd", "example_converted.qmd")
````

3. Open `example_converted.qmd` to review the modified content.

The converted document will contain standard markdown image syntax in place of any `knitr::include_graphics()` calls found within code blocks.
